#Passive-Mult-O-Matic

Passive-Mult-O-Matic is a passive multiple for eurorack based on a design by Kristian Blasol (of Modular in a Week fame). You will find 2 versions here. One which uses PJ301M jacks, the other PJ341 jacks.

This is the version using the cheap PJ301M jacks:

This is the version using the PJ341 jacks (a bit more expensive):
The advantage of this version is that you can not short the top of a jack plug to chassis (which is often connected to GND) when inserting it because the opening of the connector is made of plastic. This will often happen when using the PJ301 based version of the multiple.
